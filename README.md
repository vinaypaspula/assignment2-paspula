###### Hamburger
They're easy to eat. Because the meat is ground up, you don't have to do much chewing. Because it's served on a bun, it's easy to eat. **There's no cutting, only lifting**. And because burgers come with an array of sides, **you can build yours to your own taste**. That's appealing too.

# Code fencing
>Vim (/vɪm/; a contraction of Vi IMproved) is a clone, with additions, of Bill Joy's vi text editor program for Unix. Vim's author, Bram Moolenaar, based it on the source code for a port of the Stevie editor to the Amiga and released a version to the public in 1991. Vim is designed for use both from a command-line interface and as a standalone application in a graphical user interface. Vim is free and open-source software and is released under a license that includes some charityware clauses, encouraging users who enjoy the software to consider donating to children in Uganda. The license is compatible with the GNU General Public License through a special clause allowing distribution of modified copies "under the GNU GPL version 2 or any later version".
