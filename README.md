###### Hamburger
They're easy to eat. Because the meat is ground up, you don't have to do much chewing. Because it's served on a bun, it's easy to eat. **There's no cutting, only lifting**. And because burgers come with an array of sides, **you can build yours to your own taste**. That's appealing too.
