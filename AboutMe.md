I live in the present with an eye on the future. My foremost dream in life is to be acknowledged and congratulated for my achievements. This craving is the fundamental inspiration in me wanting to pursue my masters at Northwest Missouri State University. In this Ever-changing universe of Computer Technology, where each new day sees a spate of new ideas and patterns rising, I need to remain on quick track.
